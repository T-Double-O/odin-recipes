        <h2><em>A Pure Malagasy Delight</em></h2>
        
        <p>On the African island of Madagascar, edible green leafy vegetables abound, lending themselves nicely to what is probably the country’s national dish: Romazava!</p>
        <p>Available meat and poultry, like chicken or the locally prevalent cattle zebu, supplement the dish and create a one-course meal.  Chilies and ginger give the dish some kick, and the spicy dish that results is a great foil to Madagascar’s tropical climate.</p>
